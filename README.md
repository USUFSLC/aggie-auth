# Aggie Auth

Aggie auth is an "internal" api for USUFSLC services to authenticate students (or anyone
with an a-number).

## How do I use it?

As [elysia](https://elysiajs.com/) generates OpenAPI specs, you can generate clients in most 
languages!

For an example without OpenAPI though, see [example.ts](https://github.com/USUFSLC/aggie-auth/blob/main/example/example.ts).
